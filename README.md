# mouse-study

Observations:
    1) The data seems fairly reliable as there was only one set of duplicated data.
    2) The different drugs seem relatively similar. Capomulin and Ramicane saw the the smallest tumors at the end of trial.
    3) Mouse r944, specifically, from the Capomulin trial seemed to have their tumors reduced drastically. Whether or not the reduction is significant enough or whether or not the tumor will continue to decrease will need more study.
    4) There appears to be a strong correlation between the weight and the tumor size present in the mice.
